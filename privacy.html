                        I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I
                        collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This

                        **Cookies**
                        <br><br>
                        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
                        identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on
                        your device's internal memory.
                        <br><br>
                        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code
                        and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have
                        the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to

                        **Service Providers**
                        <br><br>
                        I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
                        <br><br>
                        * To facilitate our Service;
                        * To provide the Service on our behalf;
                        * To perform Service-related services; or

                        <br><br>
                        I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal
                        Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
                        are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                        commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission
                        over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security.

                        **Links to Other Sites**
                        <br><br>
                        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be
                        directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I

                        personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a
                        child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our
                        servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                        personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
